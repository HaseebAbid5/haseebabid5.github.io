I remember being 3 years old. My dad took me to the library. "Pick anything you want and we'll take it home" he said to me as we walked in. And so I looked around for anything that would catch my eye. I found 3 creatures presented on a single VHS cover which has 4 episodes of the fairly new kids TV show Pokemon. Ever since then I have been in love.

As I grew older I started to indulge in more and more Pokemon branded activities. I remember it started with Pokemon candy where there would be a random pokemon stick packaged in with each lollipop. I eventually started getting into the card game, and finally the video games as well. 

However, over the years it has become painfully apparent to me that the franchise I saw so much heart and good in as a child was now turned into a mass marketing cash printing machine. Maybe it had always been like this and now I am just older and more aware of the world. Either way, it does not excuse the biggest offence Pokemon had hit me as well as many of their fans with. That offence? Well it's:

# Pokemon Sword and Shield

At the time of writing, Pokemon Sword and Shield are the latest titles in the mainline Pokemon series published by Nintendo and developed by Gamefreak. These two games were a huge disapointment overall for a lot of the older fanbase of the series. The games featured less than ideal graphics with a very simplistic and basic narrative.

Even when compared to other games with much more advanced systems like in the above picture, Pokemon Sword and Shield fell short in almost every category. 
A common response to the criticisms of the games is that they are made for children and so, for some reason, should be held to a lower standard. However, I am of the opinion that the quality of this game is independent of who the target demographic is. Pokemon Sword and Shield being made for children has nothing to do with the fact that is has inferior graphics, design, writing, and even recycled 3D models and animations from previous games while charging the standard full price of $60 USD. 

This is why I am embarking on this journey to make a fully featured clone of these games, while adding all the advancements that I thought should've been included in the base product. I will reference the Pokemon franchise quite a bit during development, however the idea is to ultimately make a Pokemon-like game, not just a straight up copy of the franchise and its systems. 

The main tool I will be using is the Unity game engine with C#. I will use this blog to post updates on the progress of this project.s
