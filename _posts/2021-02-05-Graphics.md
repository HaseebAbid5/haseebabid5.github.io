As a programmer, graphics have been a constant struggle for me throughout my years developing games. Its always a choice between having basic shapes and colours for graphics or using a variety of free assets online and bunching them together with no real art direction. However, whilst working on this Pokemon Clone project I had an epiphany. If I add graphical assets that I own/have found for free-use online and compressed the hell out of them, then it may yet create a consistent art style for the game. So I went in and learned about compressing 3D models and textures within Unity and have come up with personally satisfying results.

Here's a few shots from the starting town in the game:

As you can see, the game in it's current form is utilizing low-poly models with very low resolution textures. This is mostly done through optimizations within the engine itself, giving me not just a good overall look but also increasing performance from around 15fps to >100fps on my old low-end laptop. There will be upcoming posts focusing on all the in-engine optimization techniques that I have utilized.

## PlayStation 1 Vibes

You might notice the game in it's compressed state is giving off a lot of PS1 vibes. This is intended. It is the one compressed art direction that has successfully melted assets with clashing art styles together in a satisfying way. As mentioned above, this is done mostly using the in-engine optimization techniques, but there is a custom shader that is being used as well. The shader is called the [PSX Retroshader by dsoft20 on github](hhttps://github.com/dsoft20/psx_retroshader). It gives a very satisfying pixelated look to the textures and sort of shifts some pixels around relative to camera angles as seen here:

This is how it looks in the engine runtime with the shader applied to the player character. You can even see the spotlight layered and baked lighting same as the car above.

If you compare the screenshots of the game and the player character, you can notice most of the objects within the game do not have this pixel displacement effect. This is because not every object needs to have this in order to create a consistent style. Most of the objects in the scene are static with baked lighting and shadows. This ultimately eradicates unwanted graphical glitches and increases performance as well. The art style doesn't suffer from the use of multiple shaders due to the fact that all of the models within the scene are low-poly and have extremely pixelated textures to give off a similar, but less intensive effect. It also helps to have some basic post processing added on to the scene to blend the overall art style together.

There is much and more to say about the graphical process in general, and even a lot more to say specifically related to Unity. However, those topics lie within separate broader categories. There will be more posts related to graphics in the future. Discussing optimization, terrain, and adapting previous settings to new levels/scenes are all just a few examples of upcoming posts related to this topic. Stay Tuned!
